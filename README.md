# Video Game Branching Example

This C++ program demonstrates branching control structures commonly used in programming, particularly in video game scenarios.

## Programming Concepts:
- Conditional statements: `if-else` and `switch`
- Nested conditionals
- Input/output operations
- Data type conversion

## Technologies:
- C++ language

## Program Overview:
The program simulates video game scenarios:
1. **Health vs. Damage:** Determines player-enemy encounter outcomes.
2. **Key and Locked Door:** Illustrates key-door interaction.
3. **Directional Movement:** Responds to player input for movement.

Each scenario uses different branching structures:
- **if-else:** Single condition outcomes.
- **Nested if-else:** Multiple conditions.
- **Switch:** Handling multiple values.
